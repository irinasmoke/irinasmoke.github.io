            <h2>Concept</h2>

            <p>For the final project, I want to make a set of planters for some succulents that I have had for a few months. I will make a set of 3 planters and 3 stands for those planters of different heights, but all with a similar design.</p> 
            <img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56c308fdb09f95a9ce99569a/5947530137c5812feb941dec/5b1f4cb46d2a73641d0f13c7/1528777927174/Tait_planter+1200x800px.jpg?format=1500w" height=500>
            <p>I was inspired by <a href="">this set of planter stands</a> by the designers at <a href="http://www.bernabeifreeman.com.au/">bernabeifreeman</a>. I plan to create similar stands out of plywood, but on a smaller scale. I plan to make 3 stands of different heights, all with a similar pattern on the sides.</p>

            <img src="https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/b2/af/ab/56/37/7254a4ab8206865cd6b0de4352580cd4_preview_featured.jpg" width=400>
            <p>To go inside the stands, I will 3D print and make casts of this <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3592922/files"> planter from thingiverse</a>. I plan to make a silicone mold and cast them out of concrete. The file is a bit small (only 70mm in diameter), and I think I will scale it up a little bit.</p>
          


            <p>In summary, the techniques I will use are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>3D printing the planter</li>
              <li>Molding & casting the planter</li>
              <li>CAD modeling the stands, probably in OnShape</li>
              <li>Laser cutting the stands</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Tasks & Timeline</h2>
            <p>My plan needs to cover 3d printing the planter, making a silicone mold of it, and 3 casts. I will also need to laser cut the plywood.</p>

            <p><em>Contingency Plans</em></p>
            <p>I have built in contingencies for things going wrong in the table above, such as leaving time to 3d print and laser cut multiple times if necessary. Other things I forsee may go wrong:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If for some reason the concrete does not work, I will use Plaster of Paris like I did for the previous assignment.</li>
              <li>If for some reason the plywood doesn't work well, or I don't like how it looks, I will swich to acrylic. I have some leftover from a previous assignment, and I can buy more at the MILL if necessary.</li>
            </ul>
