                For this assignment, we had to make a cardboard construction kit using a laser cutter. I made a 28 piece construction kit containing two shapes - circles and Ls. 
            </p>
            <h2>Brainstorming & Quick Prototyping</h2>
            <p>
            I started this assignment by looking up examples of construction kits. I sketched out different shapes I was considering for the kit and made quick cardboard cutouts to get a sense of  how the shapes might fit together.

            <h2>Iterations</h2>
            <p>
            Eventually, I landed on two shapes - circles and Ls. The circles had 3 notches and the Ls had 2. Next, I created the digital versions and did a first print
            </p>

                <p>
                Once I was happy with the design of the pieces, I made digital versions of them and cut some test pieces along with a piece with various sized notches to test the fit. The first cut I made used 50% power and 50% speed settings, and did not cut through the cardboard. I adjusted the settings to the ones suggested in class - 100% power and 25% speed - and that worked well.

                </div>

                <p> Next, I tested the fit of the pieces. I tested various slot sizes - .10, .15, .175, and .20 ths of an inch - and found that .15 slot size worked best for the kind of cardboard that I had, which according to my calipers was .16 inches thick.</p>

                </div>
                <p> Even with the adjusted slot size, I still found that the L shapes were bending when I fit them together. To fix this, I mitered the corners to make them slide together more easily and made the shape thicker overall so that it would be harder to bend. These changes worked well</p>

                </div>
            <h2>Final Result</h2>
                <p>Once I was satisfied with the shapes and their fit, I cut out 14 of each shape, for a total of 28 pieces, and put them together in various ways. If I had more time, I would have printed more pieces so that I could make larger structures, and different shape variants so that I could try out more types of structures.</p>
