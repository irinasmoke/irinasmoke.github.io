            For this assignment, I recreated the shapes for the press fit construction kit from <a href="assignment1.html">assignment 1</a>, but with parameterized inputs so that I could easily and quickly adjust things like the size of the pieces and the notch width (useful for working with different materitals). To to this, I used <a href="https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-mac/5/latest">Rhino for Mac</a>.

        <h2>Learning Rhino and Grasshopper basics</h2>
        <p>
        I started this assignment by getting familiar with the basics in Rhino and Grasshopper. I found it fairly straightforward to get the basic shapes from my original kit set up. However, some challenges I encountered were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Looking up the names of commands without knowing what I should  be Googling (e.g. "Fillet," "Scribble")</li>
            <li>Understanding my own file. Keeping track of what items, particularly "Math" items, meant in Grasshopper</li>
        </ul>



        <h3>Cleaning up the file</h3>

            <p class="caption"></p>
        </div>
        <p>The most challenging part of this project was keeping the grasshopper file tidy and keeping track of what elements corresponded to what. I started out working by not labeling items - e.g. having things named "Subtraction" or "Vector," but I would get very confused once I came back to the file after having not looked at it for a while. This led me to start labeling components with more meaningful names and grouping items, but I did not start doing this until the end. One learning for me is to keep a tidy file from the start!</p>

            <p class="caption"></p>
        </div>
        <p>Towards the end, I went though the file and cleaned it up by grouping things and renaming them. In this process, I found two points where I was unecessarily re-doing a calculation (I found this out when I went to label the items and realized I'd already labeled a very similar thing before).</p>

        <h2>Laser cutting iterations & Final Result</h2>
        <p>
            I used both thin and thick cardboard for this project. For the thick cardboard, I had already found a notch size that worked well from the last assignment, .15 inches, which was roughly the same as the width of the cardboard. Since it was corrugated, it had some "give," and therefore the notch size worked well.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the thinner cardboard, I decided first to test out the same appraoch as with the thin - notch sizes equal to the width of the cardboard, or about .02 inches. This was way too thin. Because the thinner cardboard was not corrugated, it has very little "give." I tested .02, .03, and finally .04 inch notches. The last size I tried - .04 inches - worked well. Having the parameterized Rhino file made this process a lot easier than if I had to redo the shapes in Illustrator each time.

            <p class="caption">For the first couple iterations, the notches in the thin cardboard were too thin.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            After adjusting the notch size, I printed kits in both the thin and thick cardboard. I decided to also play around with the size of the pieces, so I made the thin cardboard pieces smaller.
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing I did <i>not</i> find useful was the final Array command I built into Grasshopper. I used this to repeat the elements, but I found that I wanted to set up my Illustrator files differently based on the size of cardboard that I had. I ended up Baking just one of each piece, exporting that to illustrator, adjusting the line thickness, and manually duplicating items there and placing them on the artboard as I saw fit.

        <h3>Settings</h3>

        I used the following settings for the thicker cardboard:
            <ul>
                <li>Power: 100%</li>
                <li>Speed: 25%</li>
                <li>Frequency: 50%</li>
            </ul>
        ...and the following for the thinner cardboard:
            <ul>
                <li>Power: 50%</li>
                <li>Speed: 50%</li>
                <li>Frequency: 50%</li>
            </ul>


        <h2>Thanks to...</h2>
        <p>
        A big thanks to Jamie and Klare for helping me as I figured out the basics of Rhino and Grasshopper in class, and for Julie for telling me how to group things in Grasshopper (CMD+G), and for Leo's writeup which told me that "Scribble" is how you can add text to the Grasshopper canvas.
