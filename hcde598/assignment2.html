            For this assignment, I recreated the shapes for the press fit construction kit from <a href="assignment1.html">assignment 1</a>, but with parameterized inputs so that I could easily and quickly adjust things like the size of the pieces and the notch width (useful for working with different materitals). To to this, I used <a href="https://www.rhino3d.com/download/rhino-for-mac/5/latest">Rhino for Mac</a>.

        <h2>Laser cutting iterations</h2>

            I used both thin and thick cardboard for this project. For the thick cardboard, I had already found a notch size that worked well from the last assignment, .15 inches, which was roughly the same as the width of the cardboard. Since it was corrugated, it had some "give," and therefore the notch size worked well.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the thinner cardboard, I decided first to test out the same appraoch as with the thin - notch sizes equal to the width of the cardboard, or about .02 inches. This was way too thin. Because the thinner cardboard was not corrugated, it has very little "give." I tested .02, .03, and finally .04 inch notches. The last size I tried - .04 inches - worked well. Having the parameterized Rhino file made this process a lot easier than if I had to redo the shapes in Illustrator each time.

        <h3>Settings</h3>

        I used the following settings for the thicker cardboard:
            <ul>
                <li>Power: 100%</li>
                <li>Speed: 25%</li>
                <li>Frequency: 50%</li>
            </ul>>

        A big thanks to Jamie O'Dell and Klare Frank for helping me as I figured out the basics of Rhino and Grasshopper in class!
