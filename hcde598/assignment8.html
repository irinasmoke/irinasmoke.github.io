            For my final project, I made a set of 3 planters for succulents and stands to go along with them. I used the following techniques: CAD modeling, 3D printing, laster cutting, and molding and casting.

            <h2>Inspiration & Planning</h2>

            <img src="images/assignment7/proposal.png" width=400></a>

            <p>I was inspired by <a href="">this set of planter stands</a> by the designers at <a href="http://www.bernabeifreeman.com.au/">bernabeifreeman</a>, and decided to use 3D printing and casting and molding to create 3 pots, and then laser cut 3 stands of different heights out of plywood.</p>

            <p>For a details on my plan, see <a href="assignment7.html">Assignment 7: Final Project Planning</a></p>

            <h2>CAD Design</h2>
            <p>I did most of the design for this in OnShape. I used the Assembly feature</p>
            

            <h2>Planters: 3D Printing and Molding & Casting</h2>

            <h2>Stands: Laser Cutting</h2>
            <p>I wanted to use color mapping on the laser cutter and map the cuts and engraving to different colors. However, when I tried to do this, it would only recognize one color. When I talked to the MILL staff about this, they said that they had only been able to successfully use color mapping when they used vector for one color and raster for the other. We could not get vector color mapping to work. I did not want to raster my pattern because it would take way too long (the pattern had a lot of small lines). </p>
            <p>Instead of using color mapping, I ended up doing this in two passes - first engrave the pattern with a faster speed, then do another pass to cut the pieces out. This worked well. I am glad I did not go the raster route because even with vector settings, engraving the pattern took about 45 minutes total across all of the pieces.</p>

            <p><em>Laser Cutter Settings</em></p> 
            <ul>
                <li>Cut - Power: 100, Speed: 3, Frequency: 10 (settings recommended by Epilog)</li>
                <li>Engrave - Power: 100, Speed: 50, Frequency: 50</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Final Result</h2>
            <p>My last step was to actually plant the succulents!</p>

            <p>Overall, I am happy with how this project turned out. In hindsight, I think that the last 2 planters that were cast were too small. I could only fit one tiny succulent in it, which I know they will fast outgrow. If I had to do this project again, or if I had more time, I would have printed a larger planter so that I could fit more plants into the pots. </p>

            <h2>Thank You</h2>
            <p>Thank you to the staff at the MILL that helped me troubleshoot my 3D printing issue, and for Leo who left extra mixing materials in the MILL storage room.</p>
